## About Me
Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am currently studying at NUS Computer Engineering. 
I love to play around with Computers & Electronics. I am also very interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering.
I love to work on projects as a form of learning experience and a test for my programming literacy. I believe the most important aspect of 
a project is to have FUN!
